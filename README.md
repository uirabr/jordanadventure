##### This game is the first lesson of Harvardâ€™s CS50, based on Scratch platform. To access the game, [follow this link](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/921352270/fullscreen/).

As the first lesson of Harvard's CS-50, we were given the homework of doing a little game or story using the very basic platform called Scratch.

Well, nothing could be more fun than using former Harvard University professor Jordan Peterson as the main character: he is trying to reach the ultimate goal of life, that is, lobsters.

Further, he must do that while facing all the monsters of his life: socialists, tyrants and villains.

This game works only in web for PCs (no support for mobile, unfortunately).
